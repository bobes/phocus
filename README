==== Summary

Phocus let's you temporarily focus some tests, ignoring all others, even across test classes.


==== Features

* Ultra simple to use
* Works accross testcase classes
* Works within contexts
* Can focus multiple tests
* Simple code (< 50 LOCs)
* Compatible with various testing frameworks


==== Examples

  require 'test/unit'
  require 'phocus'

  class TestUser < Test::Unit::TestCase

    focus
    def test_foo
      assert User.do_something
    end

    def test_bar
      assert User.do_something_else
    end
  end

  class TestAcmeWidget < Test::Unit::TestCase

    def test_abc
      assert true
    end

    focus
    def test_xyz
      assert true
    end
  end

Executing these tests (say with <tt>rake test</tt> or <tt>autotest</tt>), will
only run <tt>test_foo</tt> and <tt>test_xyz</tt>.

Also works fine with <tt>test "description"</tt> style tests.

    focus
    test "abc" do
      assert true
    end


==== Testing Framework Compatibility

Phocus is known to be compatible with the following testing frameworks (see test/compat/*):

  * test/unit
  * minitest/unit
  * shoulda
  * context
  * contest

It is possibly compatible out of the box with other test/unit-based testing
frameworks as well, but it should be fairly easy to set up if it isn't (include
Phocus in parent testcase class and set proper method_pattern. See rdocs)
