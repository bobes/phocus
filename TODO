o test (implement?) compatibility with test/unit plugins
  - context, shoulda, test/spec, contess, etc.

o handle errors when a TestCase doesn't define any test method
  `def default_test() end` works, but test count should not go up

o add docs
  - rdocs, README

o focus do
    ...
    ...
  end

  to focus a group of tests at once
